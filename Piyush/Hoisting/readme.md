# Hoisting :

## There is two phase in Javascript :

_Memory phase_ : Trace Variable with value undefined.
_Code phase_ : Run the code line by line and place the value of variable in memory phase.

**If we create a variable using let and const, then the code before these declaration will be called as temporal death zone. Here we can't access the variable**

**Function body are also works like variable and set in the memory phase with all the code inside it.**
